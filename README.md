## What is this?

The Modeling Synthesizer provides interactive simulations that help students visualize and understand mathematical concepts in biology. Each tool features real-time parameter adjustment, animated visualizations, and immediate feedback.

These tools are designed for undergraduate courses in mathematical biology, dynamical systems, and quantitative life sciences.

## Features

- **Real-time visualization** - See how changing parameters affects system behavior instantly
- **Phase portraits** - Vector fields, nullclines, and trajectory plotting
- **Time series plots** - Watch variables evolve over time
- **No installation required** - Runs entirely in your web browser
- **NOT YET Mobile friendly** - Meant for desktops and laptops.  May work on tablets.  Not recommended for phones and other low-resolution devices.

## For Educators

These tools are free to use in your courses. Each simulation is designed to support specific learning objectives:

- **Visualizing abstract concepts** - Students can see what differential equations "do"
- **Parameter exploration** - Discover how parameters affect stability, oscillations, and equilibria
- **Building intuition** - Develop qualitative understanding before formal analysis
- **Active learning** - Interactive exploration during lectures or labs
