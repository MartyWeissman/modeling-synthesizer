# Trajectory & Time Series Practice

## Overview

This study aide helps you develop fluency in translating between two fundamental representations of dynamical systems: trajectory plots (phase portraits) and time series plots. Understanding the relationship between these views is essential for interpreting population dynamics and other two-variable systems.

## How It Works

The tool generates random two-species population scenarios with three trajectory types:
- **Linear**: Populations change at constant rates (ascending or descending line)
- **Circular**: Populations cycle in a closed loop (predator-prey oscillations)
- **Spiral**: Populations oscillate with changing amplitude (damped or growing oscillations)

## The Two Representations

### Trajectory Plot (Phase Portrait)
Shows how two populations relate to each other at each moment in time.
- **X-axis**: Population of species 1 (e.g., sharks)
- **Y-axis**: Population of species 2 (e.g., tuna)
- **Green curve**: Path traced by the system over time
- **Dark dot**: Starting point (t=0)

Time is implicit - the curve shows the sequence of states, not when they occur.

### Time Series Plot
Shows how each population changes over time.
- **X-axis**: Time (0-10 units)
- **Y-axis**: Population size
- **Blue line**: Species 1 population vs time
- **Red line**: Species 2 population vs time
- **Dots**: Starting points (t=0)

The relationship between species is implicit - you see each individually.

## Practice Method

1. Click "New Plots" to generate a random scenario
2. Show both plots first to understand the relationship
3. Hide one plot and try to sketch it from the other
4. Reveal to check your answer
5. Repeat with new problems

## Key Insights to Develop

### Trajectory → Time Series
- **Horizontal movement**: Species 1 changing while species 2 is constant
- **Vertical movement**: Species 2 changing while species 1 is constant
- **Circular trajectory**: Both time series are sinusoidal with a phase shift
- **Steep sections**: Rapid change in one or both populations

### Time Series → Trajectory
- **Both increasing/decreasing**: Trajectory moves diagonally
- **One up, one down**: Trajectory moves horizontally or vertically
- **Oscillations in sync**: Circular or spiral trajectory
- **One constant, one changing**: Horizontal or vertical section

## Pattern Recognition

### Linear Trajectory (Diagonal Line)
- Time series: Both are linear (straight lines)
- If trajectory goes up-right: both populations increasing
- If trajectory goes down-right: species 1 up, species 2 down

### Circular Trajectory
- Time series: Both are sinusoidal (wave-like)
- The peaks of one species correspond to middle values of the other
- Classic predator-prey oscillation pattern

### Spiral Trajectory
- Time series: Oscillations with changing amplitude
- Outward spiral: growing oscillations
- Inward spiral: damped oscillations approaching equilibrium
